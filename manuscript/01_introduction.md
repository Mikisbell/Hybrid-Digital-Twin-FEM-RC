## 1.1 Background

Reinforced concrete (RC) buildings remain the predominant structural system in
seismic-prone regions worldwide. The assessment of their seismic performance
requires sophisticated nonlinear time history analysis (NLTHA), which is
computationally expensive and impractical for real-time monitoring [1].

## 1.2 Literature Review

<!-- Review of:
- Traditional NLTHA methods (OpenSees, SAP2000)
- Machine learning in structural engineering
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for dynamical systems
- Digital Twin applications in civil engineering
-->

## 1.3 Research Gap

Despite advances in both computational mechanics and machine learning, no
existing framework integrates:
1. High-fidelity NLTHA simulation (OpenSeesPy)
2. Physics-informed surrogate modeling (PINNs)
3. Real-time digital twin synchronization

into a unified pipeline for seismic damage prediction in RC structures.

## 1.4 Contribution

This paper presents a Hybrid Digital Twin framework that bridges the gap
between physics-based simulation and data-driven prediction for real-time
seismic assessment of RC buildings.

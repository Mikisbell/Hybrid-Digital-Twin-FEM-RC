# Manuscript — HRPUB Submission

This directory contains the working manuscript for submission to
**Horizon Research Publishing (HRPUB)** — *Civil Engineering and Architecture*.

## Structure (HRPUB Required Sections)

```

└── tables/                   # Formatted tables (CSV → LaTeX/Markdown)
```

## Writing Guidelines

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Language** | English only (HRPUB policy) |
| **Citation style** | Numeric correlative in brackets: `[1]`, `[2]`, ... |
| **Figures** | Minimum 300 DPI, `Figure_N.png` naming, generated by `src/utils/figure_manager.py` |
| **Tables** | Numbered sequentially, referenced in text |
| **Equations** | Numbered on the right margin |
| **Reproducibility** | Every result must be traceable to a commit SHA |

## Workflow

1. Draft sections in Markdown (`.md` files above)
2. Generate figures via `FigureManager` → auto-saved to `manuscript/figures/`
3. Compile final document for HRPUB submission
4. Cross-reference every figure/table with the generating script (SHA traceability)

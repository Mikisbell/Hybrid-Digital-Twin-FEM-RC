# 5. Discussion

<!-- HRPUB Section: Discussion -->
<!-- Interpret results, compare with literature, discuss limitations. -->

## 5.1 Interpretation of Results

<!-- TODO:
- Compare PINN accuracy with published surrogate models
- Discuss physics loss contribution to generalization
- Analyze failure modes (which ground motions produce worst predictions?)
-->

## 5.2 Comparison with Existing Methods

<!-- TODO:
- Traditional surrogate models (polynomial response surface, kriging)
- Standard neural networks (no physics constraint) as ablation study
- Published PINN results for structural dynamics (cite [N])
-->

## 5.3 Practical Implications

<!-- TODO:
- Real-time monitoring feasibility
- Integration with building management systems
- Scalability to different RC configurations
-->

## 5.4 Limitations

<!-- TODO:
- Model limited to 2D frame (no 3D torsional effects)
- Material model assumptions (Concrete02 limitations)
- Ground motion selection bias
- PINN generalization beyond training distribution
-->

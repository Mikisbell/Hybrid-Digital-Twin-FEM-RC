# 4. Results

<!-- HRPUB Section: Results -->
<!-- Present findings objectively, without interpretation (save for Discussion). -->
<!-- Every figure and table must be referenced in text and traceable to a commit. -->

## 4.1 OpenSeesPy Simulation Results

<!-- TODO: Populate after running NLTHA batch (≥500 simulations)
- Table: Summary statistics of IDR by story level
- Figure: IDR envelopes for representative ground motions
- Figure: Pushover curve vs. NLTHA backbone comparison
-->

## 4.2 Data Pipeline Statistics

<!-- TODO: After preprocessing
- Table: Feature correlation matrix
- Figure: Distribution of input/output variables
- Table: Train/Val/Test split summary
-->

## 4.3 PINN Training Performance

<!-- TODO: After training
- Figure: Loss convergence (data loss + physics loss)
- Table: Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis
- Figure: λ (physics weight) effect on validation R²
-->

## 4.4 Prediction Accuracy

<!-- TODO: After validation
- Figure: Predicted vs. observed IDR (scatter + regression line)
- Table: R², RMSE, MAE per story level
- Figure: Residual distribution analysis
-->

## 4.5 Real-Time Benchmarking

<!-- TODO: After benchmark script execution
- Table: Latency results (cold start, warm, batch throughput)
- Confirmation: Inference ≤ 100 ms → "real-time" claim validated
-->
